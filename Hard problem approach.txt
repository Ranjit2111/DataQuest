We split the dataset into two sets.
The first set contained the part of the dataframe which had known target values i.e 0,1.
The second set contained the part where the target values were unknown.
Logistic regression was used on first set of data to predict the target values and achieved 88 percent accuracy.
Then we used this trained model to predict the values of the target column in the second set. 
After this, we managed to convert the id columns entries which were of the form 'img-[116,23]' to 116,23. We intended to use this as the coordinates for a scatter plot.

We used folium to map the coordinates given and showed the different classes using different colors. ie Blue for 0 and Red for 1.
